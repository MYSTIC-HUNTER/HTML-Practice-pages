        <u><h1><center>Tips to Study Effectively</center></h1></u><hr>
        <ol>
        <b><h3>1. Find a good studying spot.</h3></b>
        <p>This is important. You need to be in an environment with little to no distractions—an environment that will aid in keeping you 
        focused on your assignments. The library has always been a reliable place to get some real academic work done, but if you prefer 
        someplace else, just make sure that you’re set up for success.
        You might get campus fever and decide to venture outside of your university to get some work done.</p><br>        

        <b><h3>2. Avoid using phone and social media.</h3></b>
        <p>Distractions include avoiding your phone. The best thing you can do is either put your phone on silent, turn off the alerts or
        just turn the thing off! If it helps, place the phone out of sight so that you’re not even tempted to check your messages.
        As much as you may try to ignore it, you won’t be satisfied until you follow through with the alert—an alert that will most likely require a 
        reply! In all likelihood, it will end up being a conversation that could’ve waited an hour—and now you’ve just added another 20-30 minutes to 
        your study time! Congratulations!</p><br>

        <b><h3>3. Train your brain</h3></b>   
        Playing certain types of games can help you get better at concentrating. Try:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Sudoku</li>
        <li>Crossword puzzles</li>
        <li>Chess</li>
        <li>Jigsaw puzzles</li>
        <li>Word searches or scrambles</li>
        <li>Memory games</li>
        </ul><br>

        <b><h3>4. No Willpower? Enlist the Help of an App.</h3></b>
        <p>Apps like Focus Booster and AntiSocial have your back!
        AntiSocial blocks your access to a selection of websites with a timer that you select.
        Focus Booster is a mobile phone app that relies on the Pomodoro Technique, where you work intensively for 25 minutes and then you break 
        for five minutes. The app also includes productivity reports and revenue charts.</p><br>

        <b><h3>5. Take a break and take care of yourself.</h3></b>
        <p>Talking a little more about taking breaks, this really shouldn’t be an option. College is hard work, and just like any other kind of job,
        you deserve a break. Don’t be so hard on yourself. Working until the wee hours of the morning to complete an assignment might be great for 
        that class, but it’s not for you or other academic courses. You MUST take care of yourself in order to give your academic career the 
        attention it deserves. You’re paying to get an education—to learn. Running yourself into the ground without allowing time for your body 
        and mind to rest is unacceptable.</p><br>

        <b><h3>6. Organize lectures notes.</h3></b>
        <p>The best way to do is to transcribe the recorded lecture notes. This way, you can rewind what you didn’t understand. 
        It also behooves you to revisit those notes—while the material is fresh in your mind and rewrite them in a style that’s more legible 
        and review-friendly. On the day of the exam, you’ll be glad you did.</p><br>

        
        <b><h3>7. Join or create a study group.</h3></b>
        <p>Finding fellow students who are struggling to understand the coursework can be comforting. However, joining or creating a study group isn’t 
        just because misery loves company, it’s about teamwork. Guaranteed someone in your study group can help you through a certain assignment 
        you’re struggling with and you’ll be able to do the same. It’s all about helping each other succeed!</p><br>

        
        <b><h3>8. Aromatherapy, plants and music.</h3></b>
        <p>Science is always tinkering with nature, but in this case, in a simple way, only studying the effects of essential oils and plants 
        on concentration, focus, and memory. Some studies have shown that lavender has a good effect on memory, however, others have shown that 
        its effect is negligible and in fact, lavender oil and teas are used to relax the body in preparation for sleep.</p>
        
        <p>Plants, in general, have a natural, comforting effect and in their presence, humans tend to have a higher pain tolerance and 
        faster recoveries from hospitalizations. Music, also improves brain function, can help you focus and also eases the pain.
        Learn more about the benefits of studying with music.</p><br>

        <b><h3>9. Do a concentration workout</h3></b>
        
        <p>Concentration workouts often help children who have trouble focusing. This mental workout involves fully devoting attention to 
        an activity for a set period of time.<br>Try these activities:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Draw or doodle for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spend a few minutes tossing a balloon or small ball with another person.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 3 to 5 minutes. Try to blink as little as possible.</li></ul></p>
