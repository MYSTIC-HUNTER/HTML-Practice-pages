<u><h1>Taj Mahal</h1></u>
<p align="left">Standing on the bank of Yamuna River in Agra, Taj Mahal is one of the ‘Seven Wonders’ on the world. It is a marble mausoleum, 
    built by Mughal King Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz. Taj Mahal houses the tomb of Shah Jahan and his wife. It sprawls across an area 
    of forty-two acres and features a manicured garden, a mosque and a guest house. The construction of this timeless monument started in the year 
    1632 and the entire complex was completed around 1653. The monument houses twenty-two white domes that symbolize the fact that it took 
    22 years to complete the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>It is said that Shah Jahan has spent thirty-two million rupees in the construction of this sparkling white mausoleum. The components used in 
    its construction were brought from different parts of the globe and thousands of elephants were used in the transportation purpose.
    Taj Mahal is a slice of paradise for heritage buffs where they can marvel at the exemplary architecture and admire its irresistible charm.
    In 1983, the Taj Mahal has been announced as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p align="right">The history of Taj Mahal goes back to the Mughal era during the reign of the great King Shah Jahan.
    His wife Mumtaz was his inseparable companion and he loved her dearly. In 1631 Mumtaz died due to excessive blood loss while giving 
    birth to their 14th child. Her death came as a shock for Shah Jahan and he started the construction of a mausoleum for his beloved wife in 1632.
    It took twenty-two years to complete the entire complex. Today, Taj Mahal is regarded as the symbol of love and the tombs of Shah Jahan and 
    Mumtaz rests in this ethereal monument. Taj Mahal has been renovated several times but even today it is regarded as the true embodiment of love 
    and romance.

<br><br>Taj Mahal boasts of a lush manicured garden that looks straight out of a postcard. It is a Timurid style garden filled with several
trees and plants. According to Islamic texts, water plays an important role in the creation of a paradise on land. Hence, the garden is known 
as Charbagh where the water channels divide the lush garden into four equal parts. A pond rests at the centre of the sprawling garden and its water 
is considered holy.</p>
